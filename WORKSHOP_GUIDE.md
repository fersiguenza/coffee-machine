# The Coffee Machine Workshop: A Game I Created to Teach Capacity Management

## Why I Created This Workshop

Throughout my career, I've watched countless teams struggle with the same problems over and over again. Teams that take on way more work than they can handle. Projects that seem to have clear velocity until something unexpected hits. People burning out because they think working harder is always the answer.

I've been there myself – thinking I could just push through, that if the team just worked a little harder or a little longer, we'd deliver everything on time. But what I learned the hard way is that there's a breaking point. Push too hard, and things don't just slow down – they break entirely.

I was asked to prepare a workshop about resource optimization and team capacity. Instead of another boring presentation with charts and theories, I wanted to create something that would let people actually feel what happens when you mismanage capacity. That's how the Coffee Machine Workshop was born.

It's not revolutionary – it borrows from lean principles, kanban systems, and all sorts of established practices. But I wanted something hands-on, something that would create that "aha" moment when you realize you're making the same mistakes in the game that you make at work.

### The Real Problems I've Seen

Every team I've worked with faces these challenges:

- **Taking on too much**: We estimate based on perfect conditions, then reality hits
- **Fighting fires instead of preventing them**: Always reactive, never getting ahead
- **Poor prioritization**: Everything feels urgent, so nothing actually gets the attention it needs
- **Thinking more hours equals better results**: This one kills teams slowly
- **Not planning for the unexpected**: Because something unexpected always happens

### What I Learned from Other Approaches

Before creating this workshop, I studied what was already out there:

**The Beer Game** taught me how delays and lack of communication create chaos in systems.
The Beer Game served as the initial inspiration for this workshop. While it masterfully illustrates the challenges of supply chain dynamics, I wanted to create a simulation that was more directly relatable to the internal capacity and resource management struggles of a modern team. By adapting its core principles and adding layers of complexity and emotional resonance, the Coffee Machine Workshop was born to help people recognize and overcome the day-to-day problems I've seen in countless real-world teams.
 **Lean Manufacturing** showed me that constraints aren't always where you think they are. **Kanban** demonstrated that limiting work in progress actually speeds things up. **Theory of Constraints** helped me understand that every system has a bottleneck – the question is whether you know where it is.

But most of these exercises feel too academic or too removed from daily work. I wanted something that felt real, that created actual stress and pressure, so people could recognize those feelings when they happened at work.

## How the Game Works

I chose a coffee machine as the central metaphor because everyone understands it. You have orders coming in, resources you need to manage (coffee beans, time, machine capacity), and constraints that pop up (machine breaks, supplier delays, quality issues). It's simple enough that you can learn it quickly, but complex enough that you'll make real mistakes under pressure.

The key is that this isn't just about understanding concepts – it's about feeling them. When you're halfway through a round and realize you're out of resources, your heart rate actually goes up. When you have to choose between two urgent orders and you know you can't do both well, you feel that stress. That's the point.

When you run the workshop you will see same patterns, repeating over and over:

1. **Teams start confident** – they think they've got this figured out
2. **Pressure builds gradually** – more orders, tighter deadlines, unexpected problems
3. **The breaking point** – usually around round 3 or 4, when everything falls apart
4. **The recognition** – "Oh, this is exactly what we do at work"

### Why Coffee Machines Work as a Metaphor

- Everyone knows how they work (inputs, process, outputs)
- Everyone has experienced waiting for coffee when the machine is broken
- It's easy to understand capacity limits (you can only make so much at once)
- Quality matters (a bad cup of coffee is obviously bad)
- There are always external factors you can't control

## Running the Workshop:

### Getting Ready (15 minutes)

**What you need:**
- Print the cards (one set per team of 3-5 people)
- A timer
- Something to keep score with
- A whiteboard to track team progress

**Setting up the room:**
- Give each team their own table with space to spread out cards
- Make sure everyone can see you and the scoreboard
- Have a central "supply station" where teams can request additional resources

### The First Round: Getting Them Comfortable (20 minutes)

Start by explaining the basics: "You're running a coffee machine. Orders come in, you use your resources to fill them, and you get points for completing them on time. You start with 50 coffee beans, and each order tells you how much time and resources it needs."

**IMPORTANT - Initial Setup Example:**
- **Team of 5 people gets:** 50 coffee beans (tokens or written down)
- **Maximum capacity:** Can only work on 3 orders at the same time
- **First cards:** Give them 2 simple orders + 1 basic maintenance task

**Example for Team "The Coffee Masters":**
- **Card 1:** Simple Order - "2 coffees for Marketing" (needs 5 beans, 2 minutes, worth 1 point)
- **Card 2:** Simple Order - "1 coffee for Boss" (needs 3 beans, 1 minute, worth 1 point)  
- **Card 3:** Maintenance Task - "Clean the machine" (takes 2 minutes, prevents future breakdowns)

**What typically happens:**
- Team discusses: "Let's do the orders first, then clean"
- They use 8 beans total, finish in 5 minutes
- Score: 2 points, have 42 beans left
- Feel confident: "This is easy!"

Walk around and help them understand the mechanics. Answer questions, but don't give away strategy – let them figure that out through experience.

This round should feel easy. That's intentional. You want them to think they've got this figured out.

### Turning Up the Heat (45 minutes)

Here's where the real learning happens. I run five rounds, each one adding more complexity:

**Round 1 (10 minutes): Basic Operations**
- 3 simple orders, 2 medium complexity
- Let them get comfortable with the basic workflow
- Most teams will complete everything and feel good about themselves

**Round 2 (10 minutes): Resource Pressure**  
- 2 medium orders, 2 complex ones
- Throw in a resource shortage card
- This is where teams start to realize they need to plan ahead

**Example Crisis Moment:**
Team "The Coffee Masters" receives:
- **Medium Order:** "5 coffees for Sales" (8 beans, 4 min, 2 points)
- **Medium Order:** "4 coffees for Development" (8 beans, 4 min, 2 points)
- **Complex Order:** "10 coffees for Client Meeting" (15 beans, 6 min, 3 points)
- **Complex Order:** "8 coffees for Board Meeting" (12 beans, 5 min, 3 points)
- **CONSTRAINT CARD:** "Supply Shortage - Only 30 beans available this round"

**The Math Problem:**
- **Total needed:** 43 beans
- **Available:** 30 beans  
- **Capacity limit:** Can only work on 3 orders simultaneously
- **Time pressure:** 10 minutes for everything

**What Usually Happens:**
1. **Panic:** "We can't do everything!"
2. **Poor decisions:** Try to do all orders but with less resources
3. **Arguments:** Team members disagree on priorities
4. **Reality hits:** They realize they have to choose

**Learning moment:** You can't just "work harder" - you need strategy.

**Round 3 (10 minutes): Competing Priorities**
- 1 urgent order, 2 medium, 1 complex
- Add 2 task cards that also need attention
- Watch them struggle with prioritization for the first time

**Round 4 (10 minutes): When Things Break**
- 2 urgent orders, 2 complex
- Equipment breakdown card, quality issue card
- This usually breaks teams who haven't adapted their approach

**Round 5 (15 minutes): Everything at Once**
- Mix of all order types, multiple urgent ones
- Several constraint cards active
- Random events thrown in
- By now, teams either adapt or completely fall apart

### What I Watch For (and What You Should Too)

While teams are playing, I'm watching for patterns that show up in real workplaces:

- **The Overcommitter**: Teams that accept every order without considering capacity
- **The Firefighters**: Groups that never plan ahead, just react to whatever seems most urgent
- **The Perfectionists**: Teams that spend too much time on quality and miss deadlines
- **The Communicators**: Groups that talk through decisions vs. those that don't
- **The Adapters**: Teams that change their approach when things aren't working

The key: Let them make mistakes. That's where the learning happens. You can coach later.

### The Debrief: Where the Real Learning Happens (30 minutes)

This is the most important part. Without a good debrief, it's just a game.

**Step 1: Individual Reflection (5 minutes)**
I have everyone write down:
- What was the most stressful moment?
- What worked? What didn't?
- When did you feel most/least in control?

**Step 2: Team Discussion (10 minutes)**
Teams talk among themselves about:
- How they made decisions under pressure
- What they'd do differently
- How this compares to their real work

**Step 3: Cross-Team Learning (15 minutes)**
Each team shares:
- Their best strategy
- Their biggest failure
- One thing they learned about capacity management
- A specific example of how this shows up in their actual work

### What People Actually Learn

After running this workshop, here's what I consistently see people take away:

**The Obvious Stuff:**
- You can't do everything at once
- Planning ahead prevents fires
- Communication matters when you're under pressure
- Every system has limits

**The Deeper Insights:**
- Stress makes you make worse decisions
- What feels urgent isn't always what's important
- Sometimes saying no is the most productive thing you can do
- Small problems compound into big ones if you ignore them
- Your team's capacity isn't just the sum of individual capacities

**The Personal Realizations:**
- "I do this exact thing at work"
- "We never actually plan for things going wrong"
- "I didn't realize how much stress affects my decision-making"
- "We're terrible at saying no to new requests"

## Making It Stick: What Happens After the Workshop

The workshop is fun, but if people just go back to their old habits the next day, I've failed. Here's what I've learned about making the lessons stick:

### Immediate Follow-Up

Right after the workshop, I ask teams to:
- Identify one specific behavior they want to change
- Set up a signal for when they're falling into old patterns
- Schedule a check-in meeting in 2 weeks to see how it's going

### Long-Term Integration

The teams that get the most benefit are those that:
- Use the coffee machine language in their regular work ("Are we taking on too many orders?")
- Set up systems to track capacity, not just velocity
- Have regular conversations about workload and stress levels
- Actually say no to new work when they're at capacity

### What I Measure

To know if the workshop actually worked, I track:
- How often teams miss deadlines (should go down)
- Self-reported stress levels (should improve)
- Quality of deliverables (should increase)
- Team satisfaction scores (should improve)

## Why This Matters to Me

I've seen too many good people burn out because they thought the answer was always to work harder. I've been part of teams that delivered everything late because we couldn't say no to anything. I've watched talented people leave companies because the workload was unsustainable.

This workshop isn't going to solve all of those problems, but it gives teams a shared language and experience to talk about capacity in a way that feels real. It makes abstract concepts concrete. Most importantly, it gives people permission to acknowledge that they have limits – and that working within those limits actually produces better results.

### The Real Goal

My goal isn't to teach people how to optimize a coffee machine. It's to help teams recognize the patterns that lead to burnout and poor performance, and give them tools to break those patterns.

Every time a team comes out of this workshop and starts having honest conversations about workload, or pushes back on unrealistic deadlines, or plans for things going wrong instead of just hoping they won't – that's a win.

### Why I'm Sharing This

I created this game because I needed it for my own team. But I've seen how much it helps other teams too. The more facilitators who have access to tools like this, the more teams we can help create sustainable, high-performing work environments.

Feel free to use this, modify it, make it better. The cards, the format, the approach – take whatever works for your situation. The goal is helping teams work better, not protecting intellectual property.

If you run this workshop, I'd love to hear how it goes. What worked? What didn't? What did you change? The best ideas come from people actually using this stuff in the real world.

## One Last Thing

The most important lesson from the coffee machine isn't about resource management or capacity planning. It's that sustainable high performance comes from working smart, not just working hard. Teams that respect their limits consistently outperform teams that ignore them.

The workshop just gives people a safe place to experience that truth for themselves.
