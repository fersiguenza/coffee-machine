## Capacity and Resource Management System

This project provides a complete printable card system for the workshop "The Coffee Machine: Capacity, limits, burnout, unprioritized demands, and resource management".
Keep in mind I've vibecoded most of this, and while I tried to adjust and keep good practices, I wanted to have the game ready. Also keep in mind that the goal is it runs on github pages as well for people withouth coding skills to easily access to it so there might be some limitations of what we can do!
Feel free to contribute with improvements!

### üéØ Workshop Objective

Demonstrate how a machine's (or team's) capacity can be limited and how excessive demand, overtime work, unprioritized demands, and resource management can affect performance and lead to burnout.

### üìã Included Card Types

#### 1. **Order Cards** üìã
- **Simple Orders**: 1-2 coffees (Low priority)
- **Medium Orders**: 3-5 coffees (Medium priority)
- **Complex Orders**: 6-12 coffees (High priority)
- **Urgent Orders**: Reduced time limit with penalties

#### 2. **Constraint Cards** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Breakdowns**: Minor and major with different impacts
- **Resource Shortage**: Production limitations
- **Burn Out**: Effects of excessive work
- **Quality Issues**: Risk of order rejection
- **External Events**: Power outages, etc.

#### 3. **Minor Task Cards** üîß
- **Maintenance**: Cleaning, inspection, calibration
- **Administrative**: Inventory, documentation
- **Training**: Long-term improvements
- **Communication**: Team coordination

#### 4. **Resource Cards** üì¶
- **Restocking**: Coffee beans (normal and express)
- **Technical Support**: Breakdown repairs
- **Additional Equipment**: Auxiliary machines
- **Personnel**: Temporary help
- **Rest**: Burnout recovery

#### 5. **Event Cards** üé≤
- **Positive Events**: Bonuses and opportunities
- **Negative Events**: Additional challenges
- **Neutral Events**: Changing conditions

### üìñ How to Use

#### For Facilitators:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Open `index.html` in any web browser
   - Select necessary cards for the session
   - Use "Create Custom Set" for specific configurations

2. **Printing**:
   - Select the desired card section
   - Click "Print Current Section" or use Ctrl+P
   - Configure printer for best quality (color recommended)

3. **During the Workshop**:
   - Distribute cards according to planned dynamics
   - Use utility tools to manage time
   - Apply events and constraints based on progress

#### For Teams:

1. **Receive cards** for orders and constraints
2. **Plan strategy** considering available resources
3. **Execute orders** within time limits
4. **Manage resources** proactively
5. **Adapt** to constraints and events

#### Compatibility:
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (modern versions)
- **Printing**: Optimized for letter size paper (8.5" x 11")
- **Devices**: Desktop, tablet, mobile (responsive)

### üéØ Learning Objectives

#### For Participants:
1. **Capacity Management**: Understand limits and optimization
2. **Prioritization**: Make decisions under pressure
3. **Resource Planning**: Anticipate needs
4. **Teamwork**: Effective coordination
5. **Adaptability**: Respond to unexpected changes

#### For Facilitators:
1. **Observe Patterns**: Identify behaviors
2. **Generate Discussion**: Facilitate post-activity reflection
3. **Connect to Reality**: Link to work situations
4. **Assess Understanding**: Measure learning

### Contributions

This system is designed to be flexible and adaptable. Modifications can be made according to specific workshop or organizational needs.

For improvements or specific adaptations, consider:
- Adding new card types
- Implementing more complex scoring systems
- Integrating automatic timers
- Creating variations for different industries
- Fixing huge files
- Adding more languages or fixing some translations
- Feel free to submit PRs with improvements, suggestions, or fork and build your own, but keep it free so more teams can benefit from the real pourpose!
